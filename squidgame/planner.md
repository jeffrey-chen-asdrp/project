# SKY SQUID GAME RULES

- There will be 3 pillars with a certain number of participants
- At every pillar, the group will be forced to eliminate one or more players in order to advance
- Once they have achieved at least one or more players, they are allowed to press a button to advance
- Once the button is pressed, nobody is allowed to eliminate further players until everyone steps on the next platform

# PRINCIPLES

- Players will opt for a democratic vote each round
- Voting for someone will increase the likelihood of them voting for you
- A player is more likely to vote for another player who has more votes than one that has zero or doesn't have as much
- A difference in values will significantly increase the odds of them voting for you
- A physical scuffle has a small chance of breaking out every round, with the odds increasing if a vote reaches a tie/stalemate or if time is running low
- Each round will 90 seconds, takes 5 seconds for each agent to vote, 12 agents


# PLAYER TRAITS

- Charisma (1-100): Others tend to follow their decisions and seek their approval
- Trustworthiness (starts at 70): How much other players trust this person
- Obedience (80-100): Votes and acts accordingly with the majority, avoids conflict
- Revenge tendency (80-100): Votes for people who voted against them
- Physical (35-100): In a scuffle, dictates who will win
- Aggression (1-100): In scuffles, will be more likely to be the initializer in pushing others off, securing kills but lowering their trustworthiness

- Every player will have a list of relationships with other players, with it being a numerical value. Trustworthiness will be 60% of the value, 15% charisma, while trait similarity will be the other 25%

- SCORE WILL BE CALCULATED WITH PLACEMENT; LAST PLACE WILL BE 1/12, while FIRST PLACE WILL BE 12/12 (1.00)



# MINGLE RULES:

- A target group is announced randomly
- Agents must form groups of that size
- Any agents that are not in a room with the sufficient amount of people is automatically eliminated

- Agents can specifically request for other agents to join their group, which is either accepted or declined depending on their relationship factor


# AGENT TRAITS:

- Initiative: Higher rate of asking other agents to form groups, more bold
- Stress: As the time ticks down, agents not in a full-group will have increased stress, causing them to have a higher chance of making irrational decisions
- Physical: Determines how fast each agent is in getting to a door
- TO BE DETERMINED
